"A "law of large numbers" is one of several theorems expressing the idea that as the number of trials of a random process increases, the percentage difference between the expected and actual values goes to zero."

eg.
Seeing a 20-sided dice falling on 1 10 times over is rare if do 10 attempts, But
the more attemps you do, the closer it comes to seeing 1 10 times

To spot a 4-leaf clover is rare, but if you look at a million sample, than it is
very likely you will see one.
