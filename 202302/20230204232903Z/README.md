  - The Staff Engineer's Path

The traditional expectations:
- youâ€™re expected to be a technical leader, make good business decisions, and influence without authority

But those can be hard to turn into actions,
For that you can defer to 3 simple concepts from the book:
- Big-picture thinking
  - to take a step back and think beyond the immediate actions
- Execution 
- Leveling up
  - to raise the skills of your peers, either by teaching/mentoring or just
    being a role model
And those 3 points will be what measures your IMPACT

and it all sites in a strong foundation of tech knowledge and experience
