# Quarkus - java stack tailored for speed

Similar to Spring Boot, but optmized for speed and cloud nativeness, is
specially effective when combined with GraalVM

> Quarkus tailors your application for GraalVM and HotSpot. Amazingly fast boot
> time, incredibly low RSS memory (not just heap size!) offering near instant
> scale up and high density memory utilization in container orchestration
> platforms like Kubernetes. We use a technique we call compile time boot.

Has about 10~15% of the memory footprint of traditional Stacks with OpenJDK,
boot time is also improved by a LOT
