# Learning from incidents 

There are a couple processes, frameworks and techniques there are known to help
you learn from incidents

- RCA: Root Cause Analysis
- PIR: Post Incident Review
- 5 Whys

## Root Cause Analysis
> ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_cause_analysis

## 5 Whys
> ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_whys

Developed by Sakichi Toyoda, broadly used by Toyota, it is an interactive method
where by repeating the question "Why?" five times, you can get to the root cause
of a problem, and identify that many problems have more than one root cause, 5
is not the limit, and you can reach more levels and iterations if needed, the
aim is for the final "Why" to reach a faulty or missing process that can be
improved.

Main considerations:
- focus on the process, not the people
- don't leave any form of human error as the final answer
- if the investigator lack the knowledge to go beyond a certain level, involve
  people with the necessary knowledge

eg:
1. Why? – The battery is dead. (First why)
1. Why? – The alternator is not functioning. (Second why)
1. Why? – The alternator belt has broken. (Third why)
1. Why? – The alternator belt was well beyond its useful service life and not replaced. (Fourth why)
1. Why? – The vehicle was not maintained according to the recommended service schedule. (Fifth why, a root cause)[2]
