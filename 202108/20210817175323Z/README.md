# IAM Permission Boundaries

Permissions boundaries are a feature to allow easier management of roles and users

You can assign a permission boundary to a role or user

By setting a permission boundary to a role, you can assign the maximum amount of access that role is allowed to have.
The final permissions of the role are the result of the intersection between the role permissions and the permission boundary

You can use permission boundaries to put guardrails around a user and avoid privilege escalation
