# Respect your legacy (code)

It is very common to find teams that complain about "legacy" code and blame
issues on "legacy" code, this has always felt weird, because it makes it seems
like "legacy" is a bad thing, but isn't "legacy" code what brought the
organization this far?

## Legacy Code is often underestimated

I was at this company once, which has been going on for at least five years at
that time, and had this application developed in PHP, which was its main
product, and them a new "senior developer" joined.

The leadership put high hopes on him, given the experiences of this resume and
his "soft skills". In his first week, the tech
leads of each area of the company where required to have a meeting with him,
where they would explain the intricacies of the application, how it all
connected together and the reasoning behind it, the application although
developed only in PHP was pretty large, used SQL and NoSQL databases, had
websockets and the frontend was that of a SPA (Single Page Application).

There where many discussions between him and the team, where they would find
points that could be improved, amongst which was: moving from a PHP application to
a NodeJS one, breaking the application down into microservices, maybe making it
serverless, and change the way websockets were used. Those ideas have always
been in the head of those tech leads, and as such, they were pleased to hear him
validate their thoughts, but of course, those changes would require time and
buy-in from the upper levels, and it is always difficult to push for "improving
the application" from a technical point of view, when you could just be
developing more features to bring in potentially more paying customers.

At the end of that week, over the last meeting with the tech leads, that
"senior developer" said:

> _I can work on this and re-write the application over the weekend_

Now think about how much that means, needless to say the tech leads just
laughted it off, in saying that, not only did he diminished all the hours of work they
have already done in the application, but also severely underestimated the
complexity of it.

The weekend went by, the "senior developer" didn't show anything on monday,
another week went by, nothing was shown yet again, after 4 months of work, of
both him and a small team with other 3 developers they had a very subpar proof
of concept, not ready to replace the entire application, but to only a small
portion of it.
