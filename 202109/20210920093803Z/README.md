# Don't think of yourself as a "product expert"

These has been point for discussion, people can end up in a situation where they
thinkg of themselves as more of a product expert, like:
- I'm a AWS Architect
- I'm a ReactJS developer
- I'm a Jenkins expert
- I'm a PowerBI expert

When really, they should be thinking more about what position and skills they,
in relation to the overall product and its delivery stream

So if you can instead be an automation engineer, and you use whatever tool is
best for your use case, or you are a frontend developer, and can use React.js, 
Angular, Vue or which ever framework is needed to achieve your goal.

This is important because technologies come and go, in our field we are
constantly migrating from one to the other, the latest framework becomes
outdated, a new and faster tool becomes available, you change public cloud
providers, I mean, when you change jobs, it is likely your whole stack will
change, so it is very important to have a great grasp of structure, process and
a basis of your actual job function, and you need to be flexible because so too
is our kind of work.
