# Shared Responsability Model in the Cloud

When it comes to finding out who is responsible for some fault, outage, or error
in an application deployed in the cloud, the Shared Responsability Model can
come into place to findout who is the responsible, if it is the client(you) or
the cloud(eg. aws)

The model can vary based on the cloud resource that you are making use of, so it
might be a good idea to know what is the model for the types of resources that
you are using
