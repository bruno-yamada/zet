# Zettelkasten method for taking notes 

So this is my first note,

By watching [rwxrob](https://www.twitch.tv/rwxrob) stream and vods, I found out
about the zettelkasten method for taking notes, which have very basic principles
and guides you to organically create your own knowledge database, where it differs
from other note taking methods, most notably is in its philosophy about:
- just start writing
- use tags instead of categories
- have an unique id for each of your notes
- make links between your notes

The above aims to help you organize your knowledge, some notes might ended up
not having any links at all while other files can end up with many links, and
that is how it works for our brain

I chose to have it as a repository and with markdown because I already have
several notes in the same format and I always consult them from my terminal,
where doing quick searches and edits is much easier, plus, it is version
controlled, so it just works

The method is based on the work done by Niklas Luhman, who was and incredibly
productive sociologist, having written more than 70 books and 400 articles
