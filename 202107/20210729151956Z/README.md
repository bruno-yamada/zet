# Started using acloud.guru

The company i worked for used to offer cloudacademy.com subscription for free to all employee and contractors

Cloud academy is an awesome tool with many useful hands-on labs

After the company offering stopped, i choosed to give acloud.guru a shot since i already knew how cloudacademy works

Apparently it works the same way, and acloud.guru have also merged with linuxacademy, so they have both contents now

Their subscription is also cheaper (which is good for me)

CloudAcademy is a bit more modern and their courses appears to be updated more frequently

But so far I'm enjoying acloud.guru teachers more
