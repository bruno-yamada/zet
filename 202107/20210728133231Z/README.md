#  Key takeaways from the devops reports for 2020

Generally, we have pretty advanced technology, but it is important to also improve soft skills, as they are just as important

Digitalization is said to be the Fourth Industrial Revolution

At first devops were more about the technical requirements, now that we surpassed this barrier, it has now become about human skills, process, governance and such

Compared to 2019:
- devops engineers role title doubled in popularity
- hiring is largely done through external recruiters
- Agile, Devops and ITIL are being challenged by SRE practices (adoption wise)
- performance tuning and monitoring have risen in must-have skills
- the Hybrid DevOps have risen in demand, requiring an holistic view of the devops workflow, including human, process, knowledge and automation skills
- Where before it was more about being specialist in one field(T shaped), now it is about the E shaped, where you need to have a broad knowledge and be specialist in many skills
  - the three specialties include: automation, functional skills and technical skills
- certifications are not as important as:
  - process skills and knowledge
  - automation skills
  - soft skills
- certifications are more important for contractors than it is for other roles, such as IC, C, or Mgmt levels
