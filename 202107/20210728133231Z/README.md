#  Key takeaways from the devops reports for 2020

## Devops Institute report

Generally, we have pretty advanced technology, but it is important to also improve soft skills, as they are just as important

Digitalization is said to be the Fourth Industrial Revolution

At first devops were more about the technical requirements, now that we surpassed this barrier, it has now become about human skills, process, governance and such

Compared to 2019:
- devops engineers role title doubled in popularity
- hiring is largely done through external recruiters
- Agile, Devops and ITIL are being challenged by SRE practices (adoption wise)
- performance tuning and monitoring have risen in must-have skills
- the Hybrid DevOps have risen in demand, requiring an holistic view of the devops workflow, including human, process, knowledge and automation skills
- Where before it was more about being specialist in one field(T shaped), now it is about the E shaped, where you need to have a broad knowledge and be specialist in many skills
  - the three specialties include: automation, functional skills and technical skills
- certifications are not as important as:
  - process skills and knowledge
  - automation skills
  - soft skills
- certifications are more important for contractors than it is for other roles, such as IC, C, or Mgmt levels

The DevOps human must have functional skills which include:
- IT Operations (ITOps)
- security practices
- IT infrastructure
- application development and design (AD&D)
- quality assurance
- business continuity disaster recovery (BC/DR)

CI/CD was asked for the first time and clearly it became the most voted as
must-have skill, followed by actual public cloud knowledge, analytical
knowledge, programming languages, and so forth

## Redgate report

NoSQL has come to stay, over 47% of respondents use NoSQL

Key findings of the report include:
- Among software delivery performance clusters, the Elite and High performers are
more likely to have implemented DevOps and Database DevOps practices.
- On average, Elite performers are also considerably faster in delivering database
changes.
- Large enterprises are more likely to have adopted DevOps than smaller ones, and
so are industries such as high-tech and financial services.
- Cloud adoption showed a drastic acceleration, with only one in five respondents
hosting databases only on-premises.
- We saw a significant increase of estates with diverse database technologies from
61% in 2020 to 70% in 2021.
- Overall, the Covid-19 pandemic has had moderate impact on performance and
productivity for most IT teams. In fact, with remote working, individual productivity
has actually improved for the majority (63%).
- The majority of respondents (68%) expect the budget for database management
and tooling to stay at least the same or increase in the next 12 months, indicating
the importance of it within the overall IT strategy.

Obstacles o DevOps implementation (ordered)
- lack of skill in the team
- disruption to existing workflow
- lack of alignment between dev and ops team
- lack of awareness of the benefits to the business side
- lack of budget for new tooling
- lack of support from executive leadership

Automation is key to improve software delivery and Ops performance (CI/CD)

## Puppet report

- Evolved, highly developed SRE/Devops teams have a clear understanding of the
responsability of their team
- Cultural blockers are what mostly hold back DevOps advancements


DevOps might have reached a point where teams aren't even saying they are doing
DevOps anymore, it is just how they work

## Extra takes
> The Three Ways: Principles underpinnin DevOps: https://itrevolution.com/the-three-ways-principles-underpinning-devops/

1. Systems Thinking
  - understand flow of work (eg.business > dev > ops > client)
  - don't allow defects to be move downstream or backwards
  - seek to increase flow
    - need to track re-work to find bugs and opportunities for optimization
  - never sacrifice local optimization for global degradation
2. Amplify Feedback loops
  - Once automation is in-place you will start finding opportunities for more
    feedback loops
  - With more iterations, you promote better understanding of the system, reduce
    toll and make sure it becomes progressively better
3. Culture of Continual Experimentation and Learning
  - promoting a culture that experiments, takes risks and learns from failure
    - calculated risks with proper risk assessments and recovery plans
    - will inevitably increase system resillience
  - repetition and practice will become mastery

__Personal takeways:__

To help DevOps adoption, understand the complete flow of the work, and define
it, put automation where possible, in order to increase feedback loops and
gradually improve the pipelines, promote a culture of risk taking and learning
from failure, will promote proper ownership by the team, keep good track of work done
to be able to assess bottlenecks, opportunities for improvement and so forth
