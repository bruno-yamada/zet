# 12 Rules for Life 

In a period of roughly 2 weeks I've read `12 rules for life`, a book by
`Jordan B. Peterson`, I'd say I devoured the book, for me at the pace and amount
of time I can spare for reading, 2 weeks and a book of 350+ pages is quite a good mark

I've been getting more and more interested in psychology, philosophy and
politics in the past year, to quote another someone I can't remember:
> As your intellect matures, it is inevitable to become interested in philosophy
> and politics

I started reading `Meditations` of `Marcus Aurelius`, but I didn't finish it
because at the time I was pulled into reading a few books and articles about the
Agile methodology, I'll eventually get back to it.

So to re-start my formal journey, I got the "12 rules" book, by reading it, I got a ton more
recommendations added to my reading list, many of which seems like it will be a
more challenging read, because to my knowledge psychology and philosophy books
are famous for being deep and require a lot of interpretation, instrospection
and thinking, so I really think it is a good introduction, at least it was for
me, easy to read and understand, yet very thought provoking and inspirational.
