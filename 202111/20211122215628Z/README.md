# Scrum and Agile

At its core Scrum or Agile focus on develivering value to a client, if a team
is delivering frequent features, burning through the tasks, doing all the Scrum
activities, but is not improving the project in the eyes of the client, then it
is failing at the core objective.

Agile is supposed to grant the product the ability to change and evolve
according to frequent feedback as it is being developed, feedback from
client/customers, so if you don't collect those as important deliveries are
made, you are missing out on one of they key advantages of agile.
