# The Scientific Method

> The duty of the man who investigates the writings of scientists, if learning
> the truth is his goal, is to make himself an enemy of all that he reads, and â€¦
> attack it from every side. He should also suspect himself as he performs his
> critical examination of it, so that he may avoid falling into either prejudice
> or leniency. _Abu Ali Al-Hasan Ibn Al Hasan Ibn Al-Haytham(Alhazen)_

Steps:
- Make an observation.
- Ask a question.
- Form a hypothesis, or testable explanation.
- Make a prediction based on the hypothesis.
- Test the prediction.
- Iterate: use the results to make new hypotheses or predictions.

Example:

- Make an observation.
  - VIM users work faster
- Ask a question.
  - Why do VIM users work faster?
- Form a hypothesis, or testable explanation.
  - VIM's shortcuts allows you to edit text faster, and without moving your
    hands from the keyboard to the mouse
- Make a prediction based on the hypothesis.
  (some define it as an IF THEN, IF X THEN Y)
  - If a user learns VIM, he will work faster too
- Test the prediction.
  - If a user learns VIM, he will work faster too
    - The result will either support or not the hypothesis
    - The result can vary based 
- Iterate: use the results to make new hypotheses or predictions.

Terms:
- Hypothesis
- Theory
