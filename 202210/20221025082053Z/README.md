# The Scientific Method

> The duty of the man who investigates the writings of scientists, if learning
> the truth is his goal, is to make himself an enemy of all that he reads, and â€¦
> attack it from every side. He should also suspect himself as he performs his
> critical examination of it, so that he may avoid falling into either prejudice
> or leniency. _Abu Ali Al-Hasan Ibn Al Hasan Ibn Al-Haytham(Alhazen)_
