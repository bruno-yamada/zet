# Diagram as Code

We have a lot of options:
- mermaid
- c4model.com
- https://structurizr.com/dsl (based on C4 model)
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za1-v4Zkq5E
- https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques?blipid=202010027

## Take aways
- Treat diagrams as disposable, they should change with time, and as such they
  should be easy to create, update and maintain
- Use diagram-as-code for long-lived project, but keep white-board type tools
  for brainstorming and idealization of new projects (because it is quicker)
